Going through chapter 9 - comparing two means

```{r making dataframe with independent groups}
participant <- c(1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24)
group <- c("Picture","Picture","Picture","Picture","Picture","Picture","Picture","Picture","Picture","Picture","Picture","Picture","Real_Spider","Real_Spider","Real_Spider","Real_Spider","Real_Spider","Real_Spider","Real_Spider","Real_Spider","Real_Spider","Real_Spider","Real_Spider","Real_Spider")
anxiety <- c(30,35,45,40,50,35,55,25,30,45,40,50,40,35,50,55,65,55,50,35,30,50,60,39)
Spider_Anxiety <- data.frame(participant, group, anxiety)

mean(c(anxiety))
```

```{r making dataframe with repeated-measure group}
Participant <- c(1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12)
Picture <- c(30,35,45,40,50,35,55,25,30,45,40,50)
RealSpider <- c(40,35,50,55,65,55,50,35,30,50,60,39)
SpidAnx <- data.frame(Participant, Picture, RealSpider)
```

```{r adding new collum with mean for each participant}
SpidAnx$pMean <- (SpidAnx$Picture + SpidAnx$RealSpider)/2
```

```{r calculating grand mean}
GrandMean <- mean(c(SpidAnx$Picture, SpidAnx$RealSpider))
```

```{r making adjustment}
SpidAnx$Adjustment <- GrandMean-SpidAnx$pMean
```

```{r adjusting each collum}
SpidAnx$Picture_adjustment <- SpidAnx$Picture + SpidAnx$Adjustment
SpidAnx$RealSpider_adjustment <- SpidAnx$RealSpider + SpidAnx$Adjustment
```

```{r Cheking by making new mean of the adjusted values}
SpidAnx$pMean2 <- (SpidAnx$Picture_adjustment + SpidAnx$RealSpider_adjustment)/2
```
